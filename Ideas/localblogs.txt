Description "Close your eyes and picture any Norman Rockwell painting. Imagine Main St. in the town where that painting exists.
People lament the loss of Main St. but Main St. didn't disappear, like many things it just shifted online.
Explore the idea of developing a niche community and how to use your platform to mould your community."


Extended Information for Organizers: Three years ago my brother-in-law took his family out to dinner at their favorite restaurant. As they arrived the chef was locking the door and closing his business because he couldn't pay the electric bill. My brother-in-law watched this man's dream die and decided we could do something to support small local restaurant owners.
We launched a restaurant review website and quickly became the largest foodie account on social networks in our metro area.
Size is good, but impact is better. We've helped several restaurants on the brink of closing, we've raised awareness of local chefs doing awesome things in the community and we're very proud and excited to see what's next. Out of this site we've built a monthly "foodie adventure" series that takes us into a lesser known restaurant for a six course meal. The exposure for theses events is huge for these restaurants!
Generally this talk will be encouragement to use a website as a tool to grow and improve community plus specific strategies to employ including how to stay positive, leverage social without being annoying, and do something you're proud of.
