Outline:

* Why shipping matters - Shipping is not simply a box and a label. You owe your buyer the best quality you're able.
	* Brand - Your product is good but your package is tragic. Give your customer a transaction that is magic!
	* First Impression - First impressions don't just apply to first dates.  Your product is fine, but your shipment was late?
	* Customer Service - The order ain't finished when out your door leaves.  A customer isn't happy until the orders received.
	* Expense - Shipping is pricey, but doubly when wrong. If you mis-ship often your business won't last long.
* What to think about - So, how do we do ship products with grace and ease.  Follow along and your customers you'll please.
	* Packaging - When products can ship in the boxes they're in.  Your job becomes easier and surely you'll grin.
	* Staff - Envelopes, Tape, Labels and Printers.  But the key to the shipment is the people that deliver. 
	* When to ship - The orders arrive faster than expected.  Your shipping department will soon be wrecked(ed)
	* How to pay? - US Post doesn't give credit despite the bling that you flash. "In God we trust, all others pay cash"
	* To insure or not to insure 
* Carriers - Who leaves with your package? Who can you trust? Purple, the Eagle and Brown trucks that hide rust.
	* USPS - Despite politics, these folks get it done.  Come hail, high water, or blistering sun.
		* FC - Cheap, Fast and Good - pick the outer two. Your mother will not mind at all if you do.
		* Priority (includes insurance) - What's the catch? Am I stealing, did I misread my screen. When priority works, shippings a dream!
		* Parcel - This is not logical, this is not great. It's pricey, it's slow, it's probably a mistake.
		* US Military - Postal is the option for A or FPO. Shipping to military...oh the places your package will go.
	* FedEx - Started at Yale, with headquarters in Memphis, Fred Smith built a company that couldn't be messed with.
		* Ground/Residential - Understand the difference between ground and resi- delivery fees can be extremely heavy.
		* Express - To ship next day or internationally a small secondary truck is what you'll need.
		* Smart Post - FedEx will get your box to the final destination. Then USPS will handle it on their everyday trip.
